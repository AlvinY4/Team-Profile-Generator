# Team-Profile-Generator
## Description 
For this assignment I built a profile generator that teams can use to create a profile for their team, that displays each persons role, id, email, and GitHub account. The user can simply use the node command in the terminal and answer the prompt questions, then when finised a HTML file that contains all the information the user inputed about their team. The image below is an example of the finished HTML file in the browser.
